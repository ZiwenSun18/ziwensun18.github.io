My name is Ziwen Sun, currently working as a predoctoral Research Fellow at [Stanford GSB](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/) and the [Global Capital Allocation Project](https://www.globalcapitalallocation.com/). I finished my Master's degree in Social Sciences (Economics Concentration) at UChicago in 2022, and my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematical Economics and Finance at Xi'an Jiaotong University in China in 2021. 

My primary research area is the intersection of international finance and monetary economics, with a broad interest in macroeconomics. I am currently applying to PhD program in finance and economics. If you are seeing this website, I probably submitted an application to your department/school. Feel free to ask me any questions! I can be reached at [ziwensun@stanford.edu](ziwensun@stanford.edu)

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
